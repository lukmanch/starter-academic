I am Christopher Lukman, a media researcher based in Berlin, that also happens to be my hometown. I am working on “Cuteness and the Popular Aesthetics of Videogames”. My other research interests include the history of aesthetic theory and media of relaxation, most notably meditation.

Other than that, I am part of the coordination team of the Network for Decent Labour in Academia (NGAWiss) that strives for a reform of German academia, and I am also doing freelance work in Science Communication for IMAGINARY, as well as occasional copywriting for A. MAZE.
