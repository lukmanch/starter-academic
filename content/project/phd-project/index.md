What is the ‘popular’ of the popular aesthetic of videogames? Instead of its direct translation of the address of the people (*populus*), the popular shall be understood in its relation to the *masses.* From this perspective, the commercial videogame appears as the invention of the mass consumer’s society (König 2008), in which the practice of consumption transforms the general culture of perception and affect (Baßler/Drügh 2020). In this context, cuteness emerges as the aesthetic “that speaks to our desire for a simpler, more intimate relation to our commodities“ (Ngai 2015: 31). First introduced to the consumer society through commodities of play (e.g. puppets and toys), cuteness entertains fruitful affinities to playfulness and play culture since its beginnings. It is therefore no coincidence that cuteness stands at the very core of the videogame industry as well. From *Pac-Man*, the icon of early videogaming, and *Nintendo,* one of the most influential game and console producers, to the idiosyncratic games of Keita Takahashi (*Katamari Damacy*, *Wattam*), and countless celebrated Indie-Games in the West (*Undertale*, *Minit*, or *Super Meat Boy*), it shaped the videogame industry like no other aesthetic category. But what is its structure of judgment? What are its affinities with the mediality of videogames? And in what way can it stand paradigmatically for the *Popular* of videogames aesthetics in general? By answering these questions, the project hopes to make an original contribution to the emergent discipline of videogame aesthetics, linking media aesthetics with philosophical aesthetics.
